<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this exercise, we will utilize the Gutenberg Project library to extract text from public domain works. Our objective is to analyze complex data, such as text, and create visualizations, such as word clouds and bar plots, to gain deeper insights into the vocabulary and themes present in these public domain works. Below, I’ll provide more details on using a lexicon package for sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>We will now utilize the <em>textdata</em> package, which provides diverse lexicons and labeled text datasets for classification and analysis purposes. This package will enable us to examine the cleaned text from earlier and identify all positive and negative words. Using this library simplifies the identification of these words, but its drawback lies in limited flexibility and potential omissions.</p>
