    "text": "Professional Background\n\nI’ve recently taken on the role of Financial Analyst with HEB’s Organizational Design team within the Corporate HR department. Prior to joining HEB, I gained valuable experience in various positions:\n\nAt iHeartMedia, I served as a People Analyst, where I provided valuable insights and recommendations to help leadership gauge the health of the workforce.\nAt RBFCU, I worked as a Business Risk Analyst in the Consumer Lending department, refining my skills in risk assessment and analysis.\nMy career began at Rackspace, where I worked as a People Analytics Specialist. It was here that I discovered my passion for the field and laid the foundation for my career trajectory.\n\nThroughout my experience in this program, I have developed proficiency in various programming languages and tools, such as Python, SQL, SAS Enterprise Guide, R, and Tableau. My goal for this course is to strengthen my R skills to improve my analytical capabilities and apply these tools and techniques effectively in my current role."

    "text": "For this exercise, I explored charts and data from the 538 website. Among several interesting visualizations, one stood out: a scatterplot detailing mentions of 2016 primary candidates in hip-hop songs. I found this chart interesting due to its interactive nature. It features a tooltip that provides details such as the specific line referencing a candidate in the song, the album release date, song title, artist, and the candidate mentioned. My goal to recreate this interactive scatterplot to explore and analyze similar trends in cultural references to political figures in music.\nI utilized ChatGPT to recreate the chart based on a specific prompt. I uploaded the original file from the 538 website and also attached a screenshot of the plot to aid in the recreation process. For more details on the prompts used and the complexity involved in recreating the chart, please refer to the Plotting section where I delve deeper into these aspects."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.
